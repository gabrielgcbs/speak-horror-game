SPEAK is an educational horror game made using <a href=https://p5js.org>p5.js</a> and <a href=https://p5play.org>p5.play</a>.

In this game, a boy enters an old abandoned haunted madhouse and gets locked in. You control a security guard who can talk to and see the boy from the cameras, to save him you must give voice commands using your mic, but don't take too long, otherwise the boy is not getting out alive.

So...

## Is your english good enough to save a life?
